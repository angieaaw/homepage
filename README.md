# angieaaws homepage
Today I got up from bed and wanted to write html because I haven't done it in a long while, so I wrote this very simple homepage I set as my Firefox start page.
I uploaded this here just to make it public, but if you want to clone or fork the repo and customizing it to your own likings, I'm perfectly okay with that.
It is intended to use the "Solarized Light" colorscheme, so you can change it if you want.
If you're on Linux (like I am) and you want to use it (perhaps changing shortcuts, because not everyone uses the same websites I do), in the "Custom URL" option in Firefox settings, type "file:///folder/where/you/have/the/file/stored".
